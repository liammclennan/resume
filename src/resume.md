Resume of Liam McLennan
================

<div id="project-history">

TL;DR
-----

I love to create things for the web and mobile. I like neat solutions to difficult problems.

Background
----------

I have been a professional software developer since 2001.  

I believe that focusing on quality is the way to maximise productivity, and if it needs to work then it needs to be tested.

Interesting projects
----------------------------

### 2013: [Listagram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.onashirt.listagram&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5vbmFzaGlydC5saXN0YWdyYW0iXQ..)

Listagram is my experiment creating a multi-platform html-based mobile application, packaged with phonegap. It solves the famous 'wife wants to send me a grocery list' problem. The [source is on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/liammclennan/list-a-gram).

### 2013: Collection House

[Collection House](http://www.collectionhouse.com.au/) ([CLH](http://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/companyInfo.do?by=asxCode&allinfo=&asxCode=clh)) is one of Australia's largest debt collection agencies. Consulting for [Readify](http://readify.net/) I led a small team developing a number of internal line-of-business applications. This project was a great experience introducing a structured development process into a traditionally ad-hoc enterprise environment. 

### 2012: [Eagleboys.com.au](https://orders.eagleboys.com.au/fulfillment/pickup)

Consulting for [Readify](http://readify.net/) I designed and implemented a new web site for Australia's third largest pizza company. To facilitate advanced UI features I was asked to implement a rich client-side interface. The UI is built with backbone.js and handlebars.

### 2012: [Pluralsight's Backbone Fundamentals course](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/backbone-fundamentals)

As I was working on the new Eagleboys site I prepared a comprehensive Backbone.js screencast course for Pluralsight.

### 2012: [This resume](https://github.com/liammclennan/resume)

As a web developer I think my resume should be online. This resume is built with pandoc, markdown and a simple bash script. 

### 2012: VPS project for Department of Education and Training

I was the lead front-end developer on this large (~40 person) project. As lead front-end developer my responsibility was to ensure consistency and quality in the application's user interface layer. This included enhancing Microsoft's Asp.Net Mvc framework to suit the project's needs and the design and development of reusable JavaScript components.

### 2011: Waste water tracking application for the Queensland Department of Environment 

I held a leadership position in a small team that developed a web-based system for polluters to report their water analysis results to the Department of Environment. I worked closely with the customers to convert user stories into scenarios, which then drove the development as executable specifications. The application was built with Microsoft's Asp.Net mvc and an Oracle database.  

### 2011: [JavaScript and CoffeeScript training screencasts for Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Authors/Details?handle=liam-mclennan)

I recorded a couple of screencasts to share my love of software development. The JavaScript screencast is one of pluralsight's most popular.  

### 2010: [JavaScript Koans](https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans)

JavaScript is a misunderstood programming language. I built the JavaScript Koans project to help people understand it better. The koans are a set of failing tests that teach important aspects of JavaScript. They are delivered as a QUnit page divided into fifteen logical modules.

### 2010-2011: [QikPress](http://www.geoqik.com.au/publish.html)

QikPress is an online publishing tool specially designed for documents with spatial content. It was developed for organisations wishing to publish environmental impact statements and other similar documents. It supports public commenting, intelligent searching and maintainable inter and intra document linking. The key technologies used are Asp.Net Mvc, Sql Server and jQuery.

### 2010: Shortest Route

Shortest Route is a road navigation service that provides an approximate solution to the travelling salesman problem. It was designed to help people plan the most efficient road journey visiting a set of locations. The calculation was an implementation of the [match twice and stitch heuristic](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637704000471) (Kahng, Reda 2004) that utilized Microsoft's Virtual Earth for calculating path costs and Google Maps for reverse geocoding and mapping.

### 2008-2009: Starmate Fleet Tracking

As an independant developer I built [Starmate's fleet tracking application](http://www.gpsinnovations.com.au/content/?id=24) (since renamed Fleet Connect). It is a soft-realtime single page application that provides mapping and analytics to support vehicle fleet tracking and management. Starmate was a startup that developed its own tracking hardware so the application was required to support both the custom hardware and existing tracking devices.

Areas of interest
------------------------

### Web applications

As time goes by I see web applications increasingly moving towards the client, with the server functioning as a data provider.

 * Asp.Net Mvc
 * Sinatra
 * Backbone.js
 * node.js
 * Html5
 * Phonegap
 * jQuery

### Programming languages

Wikipedia's article on [Linguistic relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) says, "the structure of a language affects the ways in which its speakers are able to conceptualize their world". This also applies to programming languages. I am interested in languages that help me to focus on the problem and ignore the syntax.

 * JavaScript / CoffeeScript
 * Ruby
 * C#
 * Functional programming
 
### NoSql
 
  A relational data model is not always required. NoSql data storage can be a higly-scalable, low friction solution.

  * mongodb
  * couchdb
  * riak

### Mobile

 * Cross-platform mobile development (using tools like phonegap)
 * Designing websites for mobile
