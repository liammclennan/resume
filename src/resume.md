Resume of Liam McLennan
================

<div id="project-history">

TL;DR
---------

I love to create and the web is currently my medium of choice. I like neat solutions to difficult problems and I believe in using the right tool for the job.

Interesting projects
----------------------------

### 2011: Waste water tracking application for the Queensland Department of Environment 

I held a leadership position in a small team that developed a web-based system for polluters to report their water analysis results to the Department of Environment. I worked closely with the customers to convert user stories into scenarios, which then drove the development as executable specifications. The application was built with Microsoft's Asp.Net mvc and an Oracle database.  

### 2011: [JavaScript and CoffeeScript training screencasts for Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Authors/Details?handle=liam-mclennan)

I recorded a couple of screencasts to share my love of software development. The JavaScript screencast is one of pluralsight's most popular.  

### 2010: [JavaScript Koans](https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans)

JavaScript is a misunderstood programming language. I built the JavaScript Koans project to help people understand it better. The koans are a set of failing tests that teach important aspects of JavaScript. They are delivered as a QUnit page divided into fifteen logical modules.

### 2010-2011: [QikPress](http://www.geoqik.com.au/publish.html)

QikPress is an online publishing tool specially designed for documents with spatial content. It was developed for organisations wishing to publish environmental impact statements and other similar documents. It supports public commenting, intelligent searching and maintainable inter and intra document linking. 

### 2010: Shortest Route

Shortest Route is a road navigation service that provides an approximate solution to the travelling salesman problem. It was designed to help people plan the most efficient road journey visiting a set of locations. The calculation was an implementation of the [match twice and stitch heuristic](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637704000471) (Kahng, Reda 2004) that utilized Microsoft's Virtual Earth for calculating path costs and Google Maps for reverse geocoding and mapping.

### 2008-2009: Starmate Fleet Tracking

As an independant developer I built [Starmate's fleet tracking application](http://www.gpsinnovations.com.au/content/?id=24) (since renamed Fleet Connect). It is a soft-realtime single page application that provides mapping and analytics to support vehicle fleet tracking and management. Starmate was a startup that developed its own tracking hardware so the application was required to support both the custom hardware and existing tracking devices.

Areas of interest
------------------------

### Web applications

As time goes by I see web applications increasingly moving towards the client, with the server functioning as a data provider.

 * RoR
 * Backbone.js
 * node.js
 * Html5
 * Phonegap

### Programming languages

Wikipedia's article on [Linguistic relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) says, "the structure of a language affects the ways in which its speakers are able to conceptualize their world". I believe that this also applies to programming languages. I am interested in languages that help me to focus on the problem and ignore the syntax.

 * JavaScript / CoffeeScript
 * Ruby
 * C#
 * Python and lisp (TODO!)
 
### NoSql
 
  A relational data model is not always required. NoSql data storage can be a higly-scalable, low friction solution.

  * mongodb
  * couchdb
  * riak
